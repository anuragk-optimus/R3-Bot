# Python Bot Framework Chatbot

This project is a chatbot built using the Python Bot Framework. The chatbot leverages a data source and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user questions.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Understands and processes user inputs.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval of relevant information from a data source with generative responses.
- **Data Source Integration**: Connects to various data sources to fetch information.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to add new features and data sources.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-bot-framework-chatbot.git
    cd python-bot-framework-chatbot
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

1. **Set up your data source**: Ensure your data source is accessible and properly configured. Update the configuration file (`config.yaml`) with the necessary details.

2. **Configure RAG**: Adjust the RAG settings in the `config.yaml` file to suit your needs.

## Usage

1. **Run the chatbot**:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

2. **Interact with the chatbot**: Open your preferred chat interface and start asking questions. The chatbot will use the data source and RAG to provide answers.
